      <h3>What is HEMA?</h3>
      <p>HEMA, or Historical European Martial Arts, is martial art and sport that seeks to revive the lost martial
        traditions of Europe. From the cruciform sword in two hands to the bowl-hilted dueling sabre, or sometimes no
        weapon at all, if you're using a historical source to attempt to perform a European martial art, you're doing
        HEMA!</p>

      <h3>What do we study?</h3>
      <p>Here at The Hilt and Cross we primarily focus on Sigmund Ringeck's manuscripts of the Johannes Liechtenauer
        tradition of the longsword.</p>
      <p>However many of our members are interested in a variety of weapons and traditions
        and if German longsword isn't your thing we probably know someone practicing a weapon or system you're
        interested in!</p>

      <h3>About The Instructor</h3>
      <p>Ben Smith specializes in teaching the longsword style of Sigmund
        Ringeck.
        Ringeck’s style, recorded in several known versions, gives us one of the most complete interpretations of the
        fighting style developed by Johannes Liechtenauer, founder of the Society of Liechtenauer. </p>

      <p>
        Famous for its
        efficient and aggressive fighting style, they became one of the most well known longsword styles in their day,
        and in the modern day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ben Smith is the author of The Art of Longsword Fighting: Teaching the Foundations of Sigmund Ringeck’s Style.
        This book explains why the Liechtenauer tradition organized its material in such a unique way, and how to
        translate the most important first lessons into a foundational curriculum.</p>
